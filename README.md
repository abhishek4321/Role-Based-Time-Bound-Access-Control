# Role-Based-Time-Bound-Access-Control
In this project, there are four roles-doctor,patient,admin and counselor and they have different privileges.We performed two tasks - we have changed the role from doctor to counselor.So their privileges also changes.And we also implemented the time bound activity,In time bound,counselor assigns a doctor to a patient based on his decease for a limited time,so when doctor login,he can access the data of that particular patient for a limited time.
